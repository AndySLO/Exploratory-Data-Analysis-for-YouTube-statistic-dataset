What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), also known as Data Exploration, is a step in the Data Analysis Process, where a number of techniques are used to better understand the dataset being used.

What we need to do generally? 
- Extract important variables and leave behind useless variables
- Identify outliers, missing values, human error etc.
- Understand the relationship(s) between variables or find the lack of relationship(s)
- Ultimately, maximize our insights of a dataset and minimize potential error that may occur later in the process

Exploratory Data Analysis perform two main things:
1. It helps clean up a dataset.
2. It gives us a better understanding of the variables and the relationships between them.


Components of EDA:
- Understanding our variables
- Cleaning our dataset
- Analyzing relationships between variables
